* Meetups are for the benefit of the community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.

* Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.

* Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers. In cases where a modest attendance fee might be necessary, this fee should only cover the costs of the meetup and shouldnâ€™t be used to pay speakers or organizers.

* Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.

* Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.
