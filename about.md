Varanasi FOSS is a community of Open Source enthusiasts ðŸš€, who love to learn and share. We organize meetups about various open-source technologies, all across Varanasi for free.
VaranasiFOSS is sponsored by [itsFOSS.com](https://itsfoss.com) and this website is forked from [KanpurFOSS'](https://kanpurfoss.org) and modified by one of the member of KanpurFOSS community [Harsh Trivedi](https://harsh98trivedi.github.io)

All the events are volunteer-driven, and non-profit. Want to be part of our community? We currently host following meetups in Varanasi:

* [Varanasi WordPress Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Varanasi-WordPress-Meetup/)

You can also join our Slack group at [varanasifoss.slack.com](http://varanasifoss.herokuapp.com).
